This is a begining skeleton version of a project I've been meaning to start where I combine all my psychology notes into a site

It is very basic, and only relies on HTML and PHP as a forum that takes in a type of brain lobe, and then shows the user an image of that lobe area and some basic info

In step 2, I am going to add in more information and images. After this I hope to add in some style via CSS. The final step would be to add some integration with javascript
